# Cybersecurity Insights | Semester Project | Fall 2023 | UCLA

## Overview
This project, conducted as part of a semester-long effort at UCLA, focuses on the analysis and visualization of international cybersecurity trends spanning the years 2006-2023. This project was developed by me [Alley Hernandez](https://github.com/alleyhernandez) and [Allison Bajo](https://github.com/allisonbajo) for our Exploratory Data Analysis course at UCLA. Utilizing a comprehensive data-driven approach, the project leverages Python and R for processing datasets obtained from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC).

The core objective is to uncover patterns and insights into the evolving landscape of cyber threats, with a particular emphasis on phishing attacks, which have been identified as the predominant method of cyber-attacks over the years. Our analysis reveals not only the annual increase in cyber-attack incidents but also highlights significant regional threat differences, especially between the U.S. and Canada. This project serves as a critical resource for understanding the dynamic nature of cyber threats across borders.

## Data Sources
- **Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)**
- **Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)**
- **Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC)**

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **R**: For statistical analysis and additional visualization techniques.

## Findings
The project's findings reveal that:
- **Phishing**: Identified as the most prevalent form of cyber-attacks, showing an annual increase in incidents.
- **Regional Differences**: There are significant differences in the types of cyber threats faced by the U.S. and Canada, illustrating the importance of tailored cybersecurity strategies for different regions.

## Visualization
The project includes a variety of visualizations, such as:
- Time series analysis of cyber-attack trends
- Comparative analysis of threat types between the U.S. and Canada
- Heat maps to illustrate the intensity of cyber-attacks over time and across regions

## How to Run the Project
Ensure you have Python and R installed on your system. The project uses several libraries, which can be installed using the following commands:

### Python
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
### R

```bash
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
```
## Acknowledgements
Our sincere thanks to the data providers: CSIS, IC3, and CAFC for making their data publicly available.
UCLA for the opportunity to undertake this project.
All contributors and supporters of the project.
